#+title: combinatorics_iterators

A tiny crate that provides an iterators for computing all permutations or
combinations of a ~Vec<T>~. At this moment both iterators assume you have no
duplicate values in the ~Vec~, if you do you can call ~Vec::dedup()~
yourself. If it turns out that this is tedious I will add it to the
constructors.

Currently this is more of a utility crate that I am using for another project,
so I doubt development here will be super active. Anyway if I can add something
you think is useful or improve any of the comments/explanations open an
issue/PR.
